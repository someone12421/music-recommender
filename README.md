## more info
- this project is not a serious project, and it's literal shit.
- most of the code was made using chatgpt (I do not endorse using chatgpt for making programs, me and moax were just bored and decided to see if chatgpt could turn the cli version moax made into a gui version).
- while most (i think) of the songs and genres were handpicked, some of them are from a random song/genre generator.
